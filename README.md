# Compare-open-source-LLMs
A website that compares them. It should involve a set of tests that you can run with a script. The users of the website won't be able to run the tests, the tests will be run offline and it'll generate the rankings/results for the website, so that it can be re-run weekly with new models.


There are lots of cool new open source LLMs.

It's hard to tell which ones are best!

I'd like a website that compares them. It should involve a set of tests that you can run with a script. The users of the website won't be able to run the tests, the tests will be run offline and it'll generate the rankings/results for the website, so that it can be re-run weekly with new models.

I have a private cloud website that you can use for some of the open LLM runs. I also can provide GPT-4 api access.

Website users: People who want to use open LLMs in products they're building, and they want to see which ones work well for different types of tasks.

You will pick the categories, design the tests, run the tests, and then make a website that shows the results. (The website itself will be static, not dynamic - the tests will be run by running a script offline)

To apply, please submit:

What categories should we include in the tests? (For example, coding, email writing)
What tests do you think should be used for the website to compare the LLMs?
What's the best list of which open models we should consider for inclusion?
Please add the link to 2 websites you built by yourself that look really nice / have a good UX!
Please add the link to 1-2 blog posts you've written by yourself (nice looking clearly formatted ones) and/or Github READMEs you've written
